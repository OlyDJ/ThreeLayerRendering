Three Layer Rendering - Blender Add-on

Automatically splits geometry into three different view layers (Background, Foreground and Focus), giving the ability to do profesional renderings, in just a few seconds by pressing 2 buttons.
Press a button to split objects or collections, and press another button to create the View Layers. 
Once you have all your objects and collections processed, you will find an interface to setup each view layer with its passes and the collections directly, without the need to switch between them (which is a waste of time sometimes).

Support for Blender 3.3 +

- Duplicate any node with keyframes.
- Duplicate selected nodes (all at once). 
- Duplicate any group with keyframes.

Why I created CNK?

When you need to duplicate a node with its keyframes, it's ok to follow the "regular" way (I do not understand why it is not yet implemented). Duplicate the node, copy keyframes from original nodes, and paste them into the new one. But what when you need, let's say, to duplicate 10 nodes at the same time? You duplicate them, and one by one you must go through the "regular steps". What a waste of time... 

How to use it?

Just select one or more nodes with keyframes, and press OSkey + D (I work on Mac). If you use Windows or Linux, just go to Blender - Preferences - Keymap, Node Editor - Node Editor (Global), and change Copy Nodes Keyframes shortcut as you will.
In the Sidebar you will find a button with the same functionality. Thats all!

How to install this addon:

- Download the zip file.
- Open Blender and go to Edit - Preferences
- Go to Add-ons Tab.
- Press Install button, and search for the downloaded zip file.
- Select it and press Install
- Just click the box to enable it and you are ready to go.

Hope you enjoy it!!!
